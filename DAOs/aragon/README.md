# Aragon

Oh wow, they have a [manifesto](https://aragon.org/manifesto):

* Very cypherpunk goal of contributing to a more free world.
* They view the internet as a dual edged sword
    * opportunity for cross-border and non-violent collaborative efforts
    * global surveillance and manipulation
* Cool values
