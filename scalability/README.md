# Scaling Blockchains

There are two ways to scale blockchains:

1. Make the blockchain itself have a higher tx capacity
2. You can change the way you use the blockchain.

## State channels vs plasma vs rollups

### State channels

How the lightning network works. Depositing funds into the network and signing off-chain messages for state updates with the ability to broadcast the latest signed message on chain to finailize state on L1.

Its useful for bidirectional payments, smart contract relationships, and compisition. But this architecture is limited to the entities who are not yet participants. In addition, more complex activity requires a large amount of capital to be locked in the system.

### Plasma

### Rollups
