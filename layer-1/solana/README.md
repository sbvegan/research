# Solana

"Solana is an open source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. The Solana Foundation is based in Geneva, Switzerland and maintains the open source project." [1] 

Solana is looking to scale blockchains with the research that has been done on centralized and distributed databases. There is a theoretical upper bound of 710_000 tps on a standard gigabit network and 28_400_000 tps on a 40 gigabit network. This can be accomplished if nodes can share time when nodes cannot rely upon one another (by no means a trivial task).

## Solana Cluster

Set of computers that work together as a single system, in this case, to verify the output of untrusted, user-submitted programs. The applications will vary, but like other blockchains, the cluster maintains an immutable ledger that will survive as long as there is someone maintaining a copy of the ledger.

## SOL

SOL is the native token, which is paid to nodes in exchange for unning on-chain programs or validating its output.

## History

"In November of 2017, Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper describing Proof of History, a technique for keeping time between computers that do not trust one another. From Anatoly's previous experience designing distributed systems at Qualcomm, Mesosphere and Dropbox, he knew that a reliable clock makes network synchronization very simple. When synchronization is simple the resulting network can be blazing fast, bound only by network bandwidth." [1]. 

Anatoly say blockchain systems without clocks struggle to scale, so their approach is to use a reliable clock to scale transaction throughput to something that can operate as a global payment system or global supercomputer.
