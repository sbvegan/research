# Proof of Attendance Protocol

POAP is a way of keeping a record of life experiences. POAP collectors get a unique badge that is supported by a cryptographic record.

## How does it work?

Organizers can create their own event on the POAP platform to customize designs and products they will offer attendees. Users can scan QR codes to collect badges and participate in different activities.

## POAP Ecosystem
