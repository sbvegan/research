# Fuel VM

An execution layer, defined as:  a verifiable computation system designed for the modular blockchain stack. There are three central pillars to Fuel's tech stack:

1. Parallel tx execution
2. The Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM)
3. A superior developeer expeerience (w/Sway and Forc)

## Parallel Execution

Ability to execute transactions in parallel by using strict state access lists in the form of a UTXO model. Enabling usage of more threads and cores of the CPU, compared to single-threaded blockchains.

## FuelVM

Designed to reduce wasteful processing of trad blockchain vm architectures, while increasing the potential design space for devs (?). Claiming to go beyond the constraints of the EVM.

## Developer Experience

Domain-specific language Sway and a supportive toolchain called Forc (the Fuel Orchestrator). They maintain the benefits of smart contracts while adpoting Rust tooling ecosystem paradigms.
